# webScout
Exploration and discovery of searching through directories and files.

This program uses ffuf, wfuzz, ds_walk, dsstore.py, and iis_shortname.py to perform a thorough search through directories and files to uncover, web paths, directories, files, and more.  

The combindedListofDirs.txt is combined of all raft-* files and all directory-* files and processed through 'sort and uniq'.
